## Syntax of logic blocks

The current syntax used for logic blocks can be challenging for beginners to write and remember. Therefore, it's crucial to propose a simple and clean syntax that could make it easier to work with. Proposed syntax:

```svelte
{@if}
{@else if}
{@else}
{@endif}

{@each}
{@endeach}

{@await}
{@then}
{@endawait}

{@key}
{@endkey}

{@html}
{@const}
{@debug}
```
