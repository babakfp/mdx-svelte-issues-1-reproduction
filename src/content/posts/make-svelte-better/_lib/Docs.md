## Documentation

Documentation content and the design needs a rewrite and a redesign. There is a lot of content missing. It's the year 2023, and there is no dark mode feature. Algolia sucks because it's not accessible in some countries like Iran, so you need to use a VPN to be able to use it.

### No i18n support

Svelte and SvelteKit docs don't support i18n. There are functionalities to add a new language or anything like that. Some developers even tried to create their own version of Svelte docs and translate it manually: https://github.com/svelte-jp/svelte-site-jp
