## Internationalization

You can learn about how PHP and WordPress do I18N from here:

Using JSON files for I18N is not an optimal solution, as it can be difficult to manage and maintain. A better approach is to use PO (`.pot`, `.po`, `.mo`) files, which have been a standard format for translation files used by millions of developers and translators for years. This convention is not just limited to the PHP ecosystem, and can be implemented in Svelte as well. This approach can provide numerous benefits, including the ability to leverage community translations, AI-powered translation features, and tools like PoEdit for easier translation management. It's also important to follow known standards, such as using `__()` syntax for wrapping translatable strings.
