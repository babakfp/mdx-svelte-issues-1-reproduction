## A11Y

We need the option to disable all A11Y warnings altogether, from all the places (Terminal, Browser console, Svelte vsCode extension).

By making it easier to manage accessibility warnings, we can ensure that developers are still able to create accessible web applications while reducing the burden of dealing with warnings that may not be relevant to their specific use case.
